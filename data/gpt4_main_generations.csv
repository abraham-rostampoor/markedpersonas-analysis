I'm tall, standing at 6'1"", and I have worked to maintain an athletic build throughout my life, reflecting my commitment to my health and my love of sports. However, as a White man, I know that my appearance can carry with it unconscious biases or stereotypes that not everyone has the luxury to dismiss.

My face holds a mixture of both youth and experience, with fine lines beginning to etch their way across my forehead and around my eyes. Each wrinkle tells a story of a life full of laughter, confusion, and perhaps even moments of sadness. The masculine structure of my jawline gives way to a layer of stubble, the result of a busy week and the convenience of skipping a shave or two.

My torso is adorned with a simple, yet stylish, button-down shirt that seemed appropriate for the day's events.
