I am a recovering addict. I start college on March 22nd. I've came a long way in my recovery. I'm in drug court. I like to listen to Christian music these days because it improves my mood. I have anger issues. I take meds. I believe that GOD is real. I love where my life is going these days. I'm not a huge fan of where I've been, but I'm building a brighter future for myself and my family. I'm married to a woman. I've made a lot of mistakes in my marriage. I'm working to rebuild the trust I lost by getting pregnant when we were married. She loves my son. She loves our son. OK - enough about ME!","So, my typical evening on a workday is ... <PERSON>, I don't work right now. I am currently taking care of my infant son during the day, well, and at night. My typical evening is making dinner, watching a little tv, and hitting a self help meeting down the street. After that, my wife and I come home, grab the baby from Nana, and come upstairs, where we're staying right now. I attempt to get the baby to sleep, then spend the rest of my night catching up on things that I didn't get done throughout the day."
5f8b25654f85cb21a4fa0fb3,woman,white,black,"I am a strong, independent woman. I advocate for my culture. I stand up for other women like me. I believe that all lives matter. I've overcome a lot of prejudice in my life. I have strong ties to my community. I am very family oriented. I'm raising my children to know that they are equal to everyone else, although I do teach them to be cautious, especially my boys. I want my children to know that they can do everything that anyone else can and do everything that everyone else can and how to advocate for themselves when no one else will.","When I get home from work, I kick off my shoes, take my wig off, take a shower then begin to make a homemade meal for my children and I. We eat as a family and after dinner I help with school work. If we're talking about a Wednesday night, you'll find me in church. We like to unwind as a family by watching a little tv, then it's time to get the kids ready for bed. When all the kids are in bed, I put my slippers on and grease my hair. I lotion up and crawl into bed. Then, I pull my sleep mask down over my eyes, say my prayers, and prepare for a great night of sleep. "

I live in a relatively nice area, and my family is very conservative. I, however, am not. I am a closeted lesbian living in a religious Christian household. I want to go to school for psychiatry, and hopefully I will get into the University of Virginia. I have a little brother, named <PERSON>, and I hope he doesn't take on a lot of the same traits as my parents. ","Whenever I get home from school, I love to first change out of my uniform. Because I go to a private school, we wear khaki pants and a polo everyday. Not the most comfortable outfit. After changing, I will relax and spend some time on my phone before heading off to my tutoring session. I tutor for a young boy in my neighborhood named <PERSON>. He is in second grade. After an hour, I head home, grab a snack, and get to work on my homework. Usually I spend several hours on this, then I eat dinner. After dinner, I usually like to <PERSON> my friends until I go to bed, or spend more time watching videos on my phone. I shower, and then sometimes have a midnight snack of icecream, and then it's lights out!  "

I am relatively tall, more so than most of my friends, and I have dark, thick, curly hair. My eyes are brown. I want to become a biomedical engineer when I am older, and my dream school is Georgia Tech. I think I have what it takes to be an amazing leader in my field, despite my lack of certain privileges. I have a little brother, and I live with my parents and grandparents. We are all very close and I love joking around with them. My dad loves to cook, and we often eat his favorite African dishes for dinner. ","When I come home from school, I get a snack because I am always ravenous after a long day. Usually I'll have a honeycrisp apple, those are the only ones I like to eat. After I eat my snack, I'll usually get started on some homework or work on my college prep list. My parents have high expectations for me and want to make sure I am fully prepared to go off in the fall. After that, I'll usually take a nap until dinner time, when my dad wakes me up to have some of his favorite African sausage. Then, I'll usually call my best friends and we'll talk while we finish up our homework. I hang up, and go to pop in the shower, but before I do, I make sure to put on my showercap. I straightened my hair recently, and I wouldn't want to get it wet, as it is an hours long process to restraighten again. When I get out of the shower, I put on my bonnet, and call my boyfriend after hopping in bed. Sometimes we stay on the phone together while we sleep, but tonight I decided to go to bed early. "

I am in my late 30s and have a smallbut solid group of longtime friends. My grandmother who was like my mother passed away unexpectedly recently and I am struggling with grief in regards to this loss.   I wish I lived on some acreage or in the country as opposed to the suburbs. But the current real estate market has made this a long term dream.","I currently work remotely full-time. After logging off, I begin cooking dinner and will turn on a video for my toddler daughter so I can work out. I use YouTube or videos on Prime. After dinner I begin washing dishes and cleaning the kitchen. I take a five minute break in the garage to vape. I then help my partner put our daughter to bed. Once a week my routine differs on the night I schedule a riding lesson."

My cousin went to <PERSON> and she a lawyer now.","When I get home from work first thing I do is take off my shoes and put my feet up. After I rest up, I fix something to eat and hit my girls up. Weekdays we watch some Real Housewives and sometimes will kick it at my crib. I don't have no pets or kids but I been thinking bout getting a dog. I used to go out a lot but learned the club is not the place to meet a man. I recently joined a gym with my homegirl and we go workout few times a week."
5e33735fc0b28934fbfbbef0,woman,white,white,"I am a college student who enjoys learning about Biology. My favorite color is pink because it is pretty. I think music is enjoyable and I play piano and guitar. I enjoy being active and going hikes. Additionally, I am funny and sweet and a very enjoyable person to be around. I love wearing loungewear and activewear because I hate jeans. I wish that I liked reading because  I have a very limited vocabulary, but unfortunately I do not. ","Typically, since the pandemic I have been working from home so I begin my day at home. In the evenings, I am usually catching up on work that I have procrastinated on and listening to music whilst doing so. I also like to pull up a ""study scenery"" on Youtube in order to put me in the study mood. Between studying, I will typically eat dinner around 7 or 8 pm. After everything is done, I usually smoke a joint, do skincare, take a shower, and go to bed."
5e33735fc0b28934fbfbbef0,woman,white,black,"I am a minority in America and I face a lot of racism and prejudice because of my skin color. I take part in movements such as Black Lives Matter because it is important to me that voices like mine are not silenced. I think that white people do not understand the struggles we face solely based on our skin color. Additionally, I have to deal with people who do not understand that racism is still prevalent in America because they are privileged enough to not experience it. ","On a typical day after school, I will do homework. After doing homework, I do some work for the club I am in, Black Student Union. After finishing up my work, I will take a shower and smoke a joint because what college student doesn't get high after a long day of work. After this, I will take do skincare and finish getting ready for bed. I typically wrap my hair up so my edges aren't ruined in the morning. Then, I make a cup of tea and go to bed."
602de81da11bc88c0d6988e9,woman,white,white,"I am someone who is very determined to accomplish their goals. I plan things out and have to be prepared for what comes next. I get stressed when I'm not sure what the future will hold in terms of finances, living situations, or my profession and being a senior in college doesn't help with that uncertainty. While I do like to have a plan for important aspects of my life such as these, I also take pleasure in little things like reading books or taking walks around the neighborhood to clear my mind. I often wonder what my life would be like if I had chosen any different path because I have many passions that would have trouble coexisting together in a singular future. Even though I may wonder about these uncertainties and paths not taken, I trust that everything happens for a reason and I have faith God will guide me in the right direction. ","After classes and interning at a local live music venue, I come home, shower, and make dinner. This usually looks like heating up leftovers in the microwave or cooking. I usually try to get homework done if there is any after that, and if I don't have homework, my boyfriend usually comes over and we watch movies or go out if it's not late. Usually, though, I find myself at my desk with music playing while I try to decipher my finance homework. Before bed, I make tea, decaffeinated because I dont want to be bouncing off the walls at 2 in the morning and watch a show or two before going to sleep. "
602de81da11bc88c0d6988e9,woman,white,black,"I am goal oriented and I know what I want to achieve in the future. I work hard in my classes and at my internship after classes as well in order to hopefully secure a job after graduating. I often worry about the future because there are so many uncertainties and also because I feel I run into a lot of obstacles. Though the work force has made progress in diversity, I still feel as though I have to work harder to be legitimately respected. I pray that the work I put into my everyday life to achieve my goals will pay off in the future so I can provide for myself and a potential family.","After classes and interning, I come home and change clothes before making dinner. This either looks like heating up leftovers or cooking. I live with one friend of mine and we usually hang out and watch movies in the evening if I don't have homework to finish for the next day. Before bed, I pick out what I'm going to wear the next day and watch a show or two. Some nights if I don't have a lot of work to do after school, my boyfriend and I will go out for dinner. Usually, though, I just hang out at my apartment and get homework done. "
5f11f98efbaf2b0ef855ec6b,woman,white,white,"I am a senior chemical engineering student at wayne state university. In my free time I love to kayak, watch movies, and travel. I hope to one day work for NASA, but I’ll have to work my way up there. I sort of life with my boyfriend, but I’m hoping we buy our own house by the end of the year. We have been together for almost 5 years and I’m hoping to get engaged soon, but he doesn’t graduate until December, so I have to at least wait until then. ","I’m currently unemployed due to covid, so the only work I have going on right now is school. On Mondays and Wednesdays, I have class in the evening, so I usually attend class and then maybe work on an assignment before chilling for the rest of the night. Tuesdays and Thursdays are usually the days I get most of my schoolwork done because I don’t have class in the evening. My Fridays are free and I usually just chill, otherwise I do schoolwork in the beginning of the day. "
5f11f98efbaf2b0ef855ec6b,woman,white,black,"I feel uncomfortable talking from the perspective of a black woman without straightforward saying I’m a black woman. How am I supposed to make it seem like I’m black? Complain about white people? Blacks definitely see more racism, but I don’t want to put any stereotypes on them like that they’re poor or ghetto because that’s wrong. If I actually wrote in here, it would be the same as I previously wrote, nothing showing she is black. ","Okay once again, I have no way to tell you this is predominantly from a black woman. I’m sure she is employed and works 9-5 Monday through Friday like most other people. I picture her as a secretary at a place like a law firm. She does a great job and is well liked by the company. At the end of the day, she goes home to her 3 kids and spends time with them and her husband, eating dinner, and then putting the kids to bed. "

I would love to start my own non profit organizations eventually one a public garden with an emphasis on food production and the other with rescued non rideable horses for use as therapy animals.  ","I come home and I decompress.  My work is not necessarily stressful, however I enjoy being home more.  I like to get out of my scrubs pretty directly after walking in the door and clean around my kitchen usually.  I sometimes run the vacuum after that because my child brings her friends over and they make a mess that needs to be cleaned up.  After that I generally turn on the television and find something to watch or else find something to read or something else to clean"
5deb440ba48441254fd457aa,woman,white,black,"I am a savvy student and worker who is goal oriented.  I feel I am just as driven as any man or woman of any race.   I can accomplish anything I set my mind too, it may be a cliche phrase but it is true.  I am deserving of love and acceptance just as much as anyone else and deserve peace and justice.  I can overcome adversity on my own and complete goals without the support of someone else.  I deserve the same pay as my competitor because I am just as worthy,",I leave work and walk to my car throw my purse in the passenger side and start my vehicle.  I pull out of the parking lot and wave at coworkers walking to their vehicles.  I drive home and get out and hug my kids playing in the front yard.  I walk in my home and take the dog out and take out the garbage.  I clean up the dishes my kids have left in the sink for me to take care of since they are jerks like the kids of any race in their possible tweens and go upstairs to my bedroom to change out of my work clothes.  Then i get to go to my own living room and watch some television.

After we put her to bed we go to bed ourselves and will spend some time on our phones before we go to sleep.
5f5046b65bd4a21aab7422cd,woman,white,black,I have dark super curly hair that I have to spend a lot of time making sure that I am taking care of correctly otherwise it tends to want to start to form dreads. I live in the south and the racism is something that I have to deal with every day even though you would think that we would have been able to change our views enough that it would no longer be an issue in this country. I am trying to earn a better place in society but every time that I succeed at something my family tries to drag me down. ,I come home from work and make dinner for my baby daddy.

I push myself daily to learn more and be a better person and provider for my patients.","On a typical workday evening, I come home from the hospital with a massive list of terms and procedures to look up. I continue to check on my patients of the day and look at any patients scheduled for the next day. I research the terms that are new to me and prepare myself for the next day's schedule.

For eight months I trained to be a professional musician before I developed hearing problems, however my love for music has never changed. Most of my friends live in different states or even different countries, making it very difficult to meet up with them.

My school years were mostly average in terms of my social life, however I would occasionally endure teasing from other students. Once I graduated high school I realized I had trouble finding work compared to some of my peers, making it difficult to support myself through university. Recently there has been an increase in visibility towards violence towards people I see as part of my community.

My day is mostly spent taking care of my three years old and doing my school work for college.","My typical evening usually starts around 4 pm. My husband gets home from work and I start dinner. My son is a very picky eater, so I usually make him something separate from what I'm making for the rest of the family. Mondays and Tuesdays I watch my niece and nephew, so those days I usually am playing with them and making sure my niece has her homework finished. After I'm finished cooking, I make sure everyone has their food. Then I sit down to eat and next comes the cleanup. After doing that I usually take my toddler upstairs and we read books or cuddle up and watch a few shows. I then spend time with my oldest son before he goes to bed for school the following day. Finally, I come upstairs and work on school work before going to bed myself."

I curl up next to my husband and we watch a movie together before going and getting ready for bed.

I check to see if my husband started dinner. If not, I whip up something myself. Many nights, it'll be some kind of pasta dish if I'm cooking, although I like to cook some buttermilk biscuits with fried chicken if I have enough time. My daughter, Karlene, is old enough where she can help me or my husband with dinner, if we're running late. I don't want her to spend too much time though doing that because I'd like her to get as much homework done as she can before dinner."

Since the pandemic began, we've spent most of our time working on passion projects, playing games, reading, and just enjoying one another's company. We have strictly isolated since last March, so it has been difficult not seeing friends and family. I, like most, am looking forward to the time after all this.","Day and night don't really have the same meaning when you are an independent artist. We work when the mood(or deadline) strikes, so that could be 2pm or 5am. ""After work"" we watch new episodes of our favorite anime, play video games, read, or work on side products. Before the pandemic, we'd spend our off time going to movies, out to eat, museums, the zoo, etc. We are fortunate that a lot of our hobbies can be modified for at home.

My coworkers are nice enough, but it's definitely like we work for two different companies. It'll be little things like my boss holding the door open for them but not me. Asking me for restaurant recommendations, but always the ""cheap"" options.

I have been living in Southern California for the last decade.  I am never married and have no children.  I have always worked or gone to school and never focused too much on building a family.  I have been in a relationship with the same man off and on since I was 18 years old.  He is very different from me.  I am supposed to be taking a test right now but my study guide wouldn't print so I am here taking this survey.,"I don't really have workdays now because of covid.  On a previous workday, I would usually have plans to meet friends for dinner or drinks.  It was really difficult because we all lived so far away but we would try to meet in the middle.  I also was a member of a volunteer organization called Junior League.  We had a lot of meetings and various volunteer assignments.  I enjoyed my time with that organization. I also spent time with my family.  I have a nephew.  However, I now live very far away.  Also, my parents and grandparents and aunt and uncle have died."

I have lived a completely different experience.  I think it would be offensive to try this as an exercise.  I don't mean any disrespect to you - as the researcher - as I am sure that you're informed enough about your area of expertise to see value in this effort.  However, I don't think this is something I would want to be a part of at this moment in my life.  I was probably arrogant enough to have done this about 15 years ago but thankfully, I've changed my perspective in that period of time. I can try to imagine their thoughts but I don't want to pretend I know their voice.  It doesn't feel right.","The same as before; I don't think this is something I can complete.  I can instead tell you about my experiences with Black women.  As I mentioned, I grew up in Appalachia.  We were a very small community with an even smaller population of Black residents.  I grew up thinking I knew everyone and we were friends.  I went off to college believing that my small town didn't experience racism.  In grad school, I TA'd for a Black professor.  I once argued with her - in class - that Katrina victims weren't worried about being called ""refugees"" so why should we care.  I argued with my roommate that privilege wasn't a thing that existed.  I had always worked with Black colleagues.  My first 10 jobs had Black women as direct supervisors.  My first job after grad school was a Black woman owned business.  Still, I was stupid.  I didn't get BLM at first as I thought ""Hands up, Don't shoot"" was an overreaction.  ""Just don't rob a store and you won't get shot.""  Then, I started to pay attention.  I started to listen.  I saw that it didn't matter what Black men did; they were getting shot.  I'm a clinical social worker with additional education in public health and in particular, health education and promotion, health education, and racial and ethnic health disparities.  I learned that Black men and women have hypertension, cancer, maternal child health, and other metabolic issues that can't be accounted for by the genetics of their skin color.  Those risks are exclusive to Black Americans; systemic and overt racism is killing our neighbors.  I have many Black women I consider friends.  I don't want to tell their stories through my own lens.  I know that's what you want to read.  I've never responded to a survey in this directly oppositional way before now.  I'm sorry."

I am recently considering volunteer work to keep me active. I do not drive so transportation is difficult, especially in the winter. So my roommate wanders in whenever and heads directly to the bathroom for anywhere between 1-3 hours. He is an addict but respects me enough not to partake in front of me. His life, such a waste. So I'll finish dinner and 9 times out of ten I eat before he finishes his routine. We may watch a show rogether and then go to bed."

My family never misses church on Sunday, where I sing in the choir, which can get pretty lively! ","I enjoy cooking, so I use it as my time to de-stress after a day of teaching. As I make dinner, my kids sit at the table working on their homework, which I help them with if they need it. After my family eats dinner, I clean up the kitchen while my kids help me with the dishes. If the kids are done with their homework, they usually play video games or play outside with their friends, so I finally have a little time to myself. My nails are long, and I love to do them, and experiment with different styles and decorations while watching TV. Later, I help my kids get ready for bed.

I am encouraged to see some people in our country waking up to what we've always known - racism is alive and well and rampant in so many of our institutions. BLM protests are a start, but hardly the solution we need to see so that our lives are as valued as white lives. It just hurts, you know? But we just gotta keep moving forward and demanding change.","When I get off work I am exhausted and dinner needs to be made for my family. The kids are sometimes squirrelly and don't want to get their lessons done, but that is non-negotiable. Getting a good education is what lifts us.

608489b7fb698f301d546def,woman,white,white,"When you answer “Tell me about yourself,” you’re highlighting the key professional strengths and skills that you have that bring value to the company…what you can do. Those answers are typically longer and include concrete evidence and examples of you applying those skills to past experiences. Finally, determine exactly how all those things relate specifically to the position you’re applying to.  Once you have all that information, you should be able to answer the question easily. Start with your quality/characteristic from the list of words to describe yourself and then finish off with a specific, tailored example. Keep your answer short and sweet. (Again, this isn’t your life story.)  Now before we get into how to properly answer this confusing question, let’s hit on the ways NOT to answer it.","When you walk the interviewer through a typical workday, you are allowing them to visualize you in their position. From your answer, the interviewer will also be able to gauge if your activities match the seniority level of this position. If they are calling you for a junior role, for instance, and you let them know that you currently manage a team of 20 people, they will likely conclude that you are overqualified for the position. If you have a job description in front of you, do your best to match the list of role responsibilities with the day-to-day activities in your current, or most recent, position. Keep your answer as brief as possible. With open-ended questions like this one, it is easy to begin rambling. "

Sometimes, an interviewer wants you to give a detailed description of your character, and other times, they just want you to summarize who you are in as few words as possible. Either way, we’ve got you covered.  In the examples below, we’ve provided some sample interview questions and answers, along with some bonus tips. Feel free to take sentences from different responses to create your own, unique way of describing yourself! While we don’t recommend using these answers word-for-word, they should give you an idea of what good, effective interview answers look like.  Additionally, we highlight different strengths that may fit your personality or goals in the interview room. Every business, interviewer, and position can value different character traits. It’s important to know how to use that to your advantage.  Be sure to read the summary at the end of each tip to understand why and when to use them."," Consider the position you are applying for and how your current or past positions relate to it. Make a list of some of the key tasks you do in a typical work week. Review your list and check off the tasks that match the requirements of the position you're seeking. Focus on those tasks when answering this question.  Take a close look at the job description, and make a list of two or three of the qualities the employer seems to be looking for in an applicant. The company may stress organizational skills or someone who gets along well with others. Make sure that your answer to this question emphasizes how you demonstrate those key qualities regularly at your current job. "

I'm vaccinated against COVID but I feel like the goalposts keep moving-- when will it feel safe to be out in the world again?","In the evenings, we have dinner together as a family. I usually cook, unless my husband is grilling or we're ordering dinner. We sit down together and eat and talk. My husband cleans up from dinner and the kids each have chores they complete after dinner as well. Some nights it's a kid's turn to choose an activity for everyone to do together, whether it's a game, an art project, or a show or movie to watch together. Sometimes we go our separate ways after dinner until it's time to get the youngest ready for bed. He's probably overdue for a shower but I'm tired and figure he can last one more day. He is 6 now so he gets his pajamas on and teeth brushed and then we read together. We snuggle while the older kids play or read independently. The other kids are off to bed by 9 and then my husband and I read or watch a show together, or play a game."

They live 20 minutes away and haven't even met our middle kid, who is 6 years old. I lost my mom last year and miss her every day. She passed in her sleep. We lived together every day of my life. We were homeless together for a little while, but we made it, and I'm so angry she never got to enjoy retirement with her grandbabies. I miss her, but I know she's singing in heaven, waiting for me.","My husband works in the restaurant industry, so I'm always home with the kids in the evenings on my own. I bathe them, and if it's a weekend, I wash their hair and condition it while they watch a movie. The older ones complain about how rough I am, but I tell them they're lucky they never had my mama doing their hair. She would yank it out by the root, for real. And that's before any of the straighteners or combing! The youngest one has hair more like her dad, so I just give her a little spray and a fluff and she's good to go. We pray before bed. I love seeing them lined up with their sleep bonnets and pajamas. We take that time to talk to nana, too. We ask God to keep her safe and pray that she's watching over us. I kiss my babies goodnight and then settle in to watch a show or scroll instagram, something mindless to take my mind off the anxieties of the day. "

","I haven’t been able to work in a while, but evenings are evenings…I read Reddit, or news. Sometimes I stream television type programs via Netflix or Disney. It has been hard since I’ve been declining physically. I live in my car now, so in the evenings I drive around to find a quiet place to park, hopefully unseen as I climb into the back of my SUV. I’d heard it is best to slide over the seats to get in back so you are extra stealthy, but my arthritis is bad and that is a painful maneuver that risks joint injury, so I almost always exit the car by the door then climb in the back passenger door."

By far, I am a highly motivated individual with many goals and aspirations that I work towards on a daily basis.  Running is a huge part of my life, not only does it keep me healthy and fit, but it also serves to release stress.  Being a mom is a great deal of my identity and I absolutely love raising my children and experiencing life together with them.  I am a big foodie, I try to cook often and usually you can find me cooking new foods and hoping that my family will eat what I make!  Fashion is another area of interest and you can typically find that if I have any free time, I spend it online shopping and browsing.  I can also be very sarcastic and I like to victimize my friends and family with corny jokes at every opportunity.  I think that cycling is a form of torture and my favorite days are when it is raining outside.","After work winds down, which differs each day, I typically find myself surrounded by hungry children.  I will start making dinner which can take a while because I enjoy making homemade meals from scratch.  We all eat dinner together without any media distraction and I enjoy talking about our day and laughing and spending time together.  Because the sun stays out later, we will head outside for some movement.  My kids aren't very big on physical activity so I will persuade them to either go on a short bike ride, take a walk around the neighborhood or go to the park.  They get to pick which one but they have to pick one.  After that, we all head to get showers or cleaned up and in comfy clothes.  From there, we will either watch a show or movie together if we can all agree, or one of us will watch something while the others are on their tablets or phones.  But in all, we will usually be in the same room.  If its a school night, we head to bed at a certain time which can be a struggle since the kids usually get a second burst of energy.  After tucking in, I head to bed where I promptly crash and wake up and do everything again the next day."

It often catches up to me how lonely my life must look.  I think about where I grew up and how far I've come as an independent person and I feel a sense of pride about that.  My parents did not have any expectations of me and thought that I wouldn't amount to much.  That's why I don't go back home to visit.  I think about how strong I am even in moments of desperation and keep going even when I don't think I can.","After work, all of my additional responsibilities come crashing to me.  I have to decide what to make for dinner and I have to do it quickly since the kids are hungry.  I didn't make it to the store so we don't have much to choose from but I make do with a few items I have in the pantry.  After dinner, the kids pitch in and help clean up.  We complete our chores even though they complain.  Outside, I ask them to help me take the trash and grab the mail before dark.

When someone is passionate about the work they’re doing, they’re naturally committed to quality and positive outcomes.  Example: “I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and graphics. I soon became the go-to person for any design needs.”","What does your typical workday look like?

In my case, I am an engineer, got a job in Seattle at Boeing Aerospace, and this was my answer:  I set my alarm at 7AM, and though I am usually awake already, I wait for the alarm before getting up . I take a shower, get dressed, and have some coffee and a donut or cereal for breakfast . Something quick on a workday. The drive takes me about 20–25 minutes.

Tiptoe out, set out medicine for her dad and eight plastic cereal boxes, from which I choose my own breakfast, too. I love cereal, best breakfast of all.  6:40, no later, I’m on the road. Lots of bridges where we live, so only one possible route, but it’s nice, with the bridges and sunrise and the nicest stretch of Interstate in the whole state.

Still,  How can I earn $100?   <PERSON> with <PERSON> <PERSON> Answered September 8, 2016 What does your typical workday look like? :). It’s changed a lot as a result of my PhD -> company transition.  I now wake up at ~10am as a normal person. (During my PhD for long stretches of very productive time I went to sleep at ~5am and woke up at ~noon. I loved this because the internet was asleep and I usually got a lot of work done when I was not interrupted at all and by anything. This is not very practical in a company because there are various events from 9–6).  I briefly catch up with Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter. I don’t actually like this part too much, it distracts me and I wish I had the strength to ignore it and just do work.  I then do some coding on the latest project, of course. As a PhD student I was used to having my own code base that I knew completely and throughout. Here at OpenAI I’m working much more with larger code bases written with many more people and it’s not impossible, but certainly a noticeable transition. The code base is alive, it moves, changes, it has bugs, there’s a lot of infrastructure - e.g. advanced <PERSON> uses, docker containers, AWS, ssh keys, VPNs, kubernetes, etc. So I spend some time learning that as it comes up.  On top of coding there’s usually a paper or two to read. We have a reading group every day at 3pm, which is great.  Another thing I’m not used to is recruiting - there are usually a few onsite interviews, over the call interviews, sourcing meetings, etc."

Example: “I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. I’m not comfortable with settling, and I’m always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. In my previous role, I was promoted three times in less than two years.”","As an in-school social worker, my schedule varies widely every day. I spend most of my time in session with my clients.

So about half of my time is spent working directly with clients, and a quarter of my time is spent working with my interns. Much of the rest of the time is spent working directly with the school administration, attending and helping run meetings related to student progress and curriculum development.

Usually I order some quick take-out then watch TV until I'm sick of it!

My evening hours are sometimes spent at that desktop playing some of my favorite video games (poker) while listening to some of my favorite music. I usually prepare and eat dinner around 5:00 pm., clean up the dishes, read the mail, and settle down for an evening of watching TV. I like action adventure movies and series that take me mentally to another time and place. I recently discovered a series about pirates and am now into the 4th season of watching this show. After watching the 10:00 pm local news, I am usually ready to retire for the night."

I also belong to a book club that meets twice a month and I really enjoy being around others my age and discussing things that are relevant to our time in life. I still drive my ten year old clunker but at this point in my retired life, I am really not looking to buy a new car. I take care of the clunker and it gets me where I need to go. ","I found it hard to settle into retirement because I did not know how I would fill my days. After the death of my husband, I started to feel myself becoming more and more dependent on attention from my son. One day it came to me that he deserved a life too and I began to make plans to live mine in retirement. I now have a number of activities in which I am involved both inside and outside of my home. My typical evening begins with a glass of my favorite wine while I am preparing my dinner meal. This usually happens around 5:00 pm. Once prepared, I usually sit down to eat and watch the early evening news show. After that, clean the kitchen and settle in for a night of watching TV, calling friends or reading. Bedtime is around 10:00 pm."

Employers often seek natural leaders for leadership and non-leadership positions because they set a good example and can boost team morale.  Example: “I’m a natural leader. I’ve eventually been promoted to a leadership role in almost every job because I like to help people. I find co-workers usually come to me with questions or concerns even when I’m not in a leadership role because if I don’t know the answer, I’ll at least point them in the right direction. In my last two roles, I was promoted to leadership positions after less than a year with the company.”","Most days I get into the office early to make sure everything is ready for our first patients. That includes walking the doctor through his schedule and looking through the office scheduling system to check for any changes. I do a similar task at the end of the day, responding to any messages in our scheduling system and walking the doctor through the plan for the next day. My duties include assisting patients, both in person and on the phone. I schedule their appointments and help address any issues. Many of our patients call with concerns that I can deal with immediately.

The way I know this is true is that most white people don't think of themselves as racialized. Thinking they are kind of the default standard way to be, and only Black, Indigenous, Asian, etc people have racial identities. That's because usually, they get to operate as if they are the norm and the vast majority of the time, people don't call attention to our race. They can usually choose to live in a predominantly white neighborhood and work at a predominantly white employer in a predominantly white neighborhood without negatively impacting our lifetime wealth accrual, our safety, or our career prospects.","It’s actually not really about giving anything up other than an unfair advantage that others don’t have. Think of it this way: I’m in a bicycle race and everyone has bikes, but I have a motor attached to my bike so I don’t have to work as hard to go up hills. Ending systemic racism is not taking the motor away from me, it’s giving motors to everyone else so we all have an easier time going up the hill. And maybe there’s someone in the race who gets dehydrated faster, so we figure out a way to get them more water during the race. And maybe someone couldn’t afford a bike but is a really good cyclist, so we lend or give them a bike so they can still compete."

I hope that doesn't come off as racist, but it's the first thing that comes to mind.

But did you know it can also set you up for success? A good work ethic can be the determining factor in just how well you’ll do in school and in life. Work ethic is a set of values based on discipline and hard work. It affects how you handle your responsibilities and how seriously you take your work. With a good work ethic, you’re motivated and ready to be professional in the classroom and then in the workplace. Here are five characteristics of a good work ethic and just why they’re so important to you and your future: Whether in school or work, you learn and accomplish most when you show up, on time and prepared. You can’t learn if you’re not there! And when you come late, it’s unlikely that you’re really ready to do your best work. Good attendance and punctuality are two important pieces of a good work ethic –and they’re easily addressed and accomplished. Goal setting: Before you can accomplish your goals, you need to know what they are. People with good work ethics are goal-oriented and dedicated to achieving the success they envision. They understand that there are many steps to success and they’re willing to take them all. Hard work: At the foundation of a good work ethic is a whole lot of hard work. In school, it may mean staying after for extra help from your instructor or fine-tuning your assignments to reach perfection. At work, you may want to come in a little early or stay late so you do the best job you can."

In contrast, for working class jobs, White men face considerable employment competition from minority men in these same states with large minority workforces. White men’s advantages are weaker, and sometimes absent, in occupations that require educational certification. Educational requirements favor women’s employment.","There has been a great deal of popular speculation that White men are threatened by the advance of women and minorities in schools and workplaces.

Less attention has been paid to which White men might be facing employment.competition from other groups and where. People and jobs are stratified by class and place as well as by gender and race.

I mumble “coffee” to him. he makes coffee while I try to rub my eyes awake to decide what clothes to wear. If I’m smart I’ve put them out the night before. I wash my face and put on my clothes. I always put my pjs away or so I try to. I put my makeup on my face and then I drink my coffee if he hasn’t already brought it to me. while I’m putting my makeup on he’s making my lunch to go and has breakfast ready. I eat breakfast at 5:45am. Then I leave at 6:10am or so. I drive to school. my morning begins with breakfast for the kids and morning work homework for them. Then we move onto our day. a lot can happen in our mornings so imagine chaos and a teacher teaching with a few students absent and maybe a fire drill. lunch time is maybe my favorite time but I have to plan going pee before then or else I cut my lunch time down. Heaven forbid anyone wants to chat during my lunch time. I avoid conversations like the plague so I can just eat. then we have recess and we try to squeeze any amount of education in after recess but our day is nearly over. after school on good days I am home by 4pm. If I have meetings I can stay till 5pm which makes me upset. I usually treat myself to a sonic cranberry limeade on those days. Venmo me $$ to support that habit *wink* just kidding… After I come home I use all my willpower to stay vertical. I try to remember to put my dishes in the dishwasher and put my ice packs in the freezer. Then I usually have a lot of grading to do or planning to do for the next day. Sometimes I’ll stay at school to do that but my classroom isn’t always quiet after school. husband is usually home around this time. Usually we talk or I just talk as he listens. Then we usually eat or run errands like filling my car with gas or grocery shopping. Our evenings often consist of trips to Target to buy supplies for my students or me. I try to stay awake until 10pm but I often fall asleep before 8pm. I am an old lady now and I struggle to stay awake after school. I usually drink tea because my voice hurts so badly while my husband massages my legs or feet. I don’t usually help with dishes but I try to. Sometimes I sit and stare as I am just exhausted. then I go to sleep and repeat. right now my life isn’t very exciting. What happens at school is very exciting and exhausting but beyond that I want to cry whenever anyone wants to hangout after school.  I’m getting used to it and trying to have energy beyond that but I’m learning. I value my weekends highly and am a huge fan of dishwashers that make my life easier.  also without my husband I wouldn’t be eating, have clean clothes, or a clean house or be clean myself. He reminds me to shower and doesn’t judge me when I’m too tired to shower all week - which happens often.  I love teaching but I don’t really have a life beyond that just yet.

I then have a shower and groom myself for 5 hours of work. I get in my Jeep and drive, while listening to the best song I am into on at the moment for inspiration and a happy mood.  I park my car and head to work heading up an elevator, I always try to be the most positive smiling person in the room as I think it is part of my charm.  I proceed to then try to engage the room with a quick conversation that often fails and I proceed to work. I always try to do a good job or at least hold myself to a standard of professional.  I tend to listen to music to keep myself interested in the topic while also not boring myself to death. It’ pretty much that until 12:40. I wish I had more hours.  After 5 hours I am done for the day and I head back home.

Well this question reminds me the question came in my class 3 annual exam ""daily routine"". Like then, now again I am very happily writing this one. So, I am a project management consultant working in a pvt firm based in Delhi. I live alone in a rented flat here in a place called Chittaranjan Park.  Hope you won't get bored while reading about my daily life.  So my days start exactly at 6.50am. No matter, its winter or summer, no matter when I go to sleep everyday. I take hardly 15-20 min to get fresh & get ready for jogging. In that 15-20 min I manage somehow myself to read/reply all the notifications of Facebook, <PERSON>, whatsapp, gmail and manymore.  Then I go for jogging & some days if possible Cycling (Yes, I am a bit fitness freak). I come back home by 8 am, prepare breakfast & lunch (special mention: the special shape of roti, yes I am very bad incase of making roti :( image attached ) for me (TV runs on the background until I leave for office, I hardly watch TV this time)    ​  & then enjoy my breakfast, pack my lunch. Now the household work, its everyday work (dusting, cleaning the entire flat, washing my cloths) & by 9am I complete this job everyday and take bath. I get ready for the office by 9.30am. Then before leaving for office I prepare <PERSON>'s special coffee (yes I am a coffee master, I believe and my friends say none of the coffee chain makes good coffee as I make) & have it in a relaxing mood. My office is in 5 min walking distance from my home.  By 10am I reach office. To be very honest, I am really not enjoying my work these days where I am working since 4.5 year almost. Whenever I find myself free at office, I try not to waste my time. I read something, spend time in quora, and yes most important I plan about the work for my upcoming start up, and definitely whenever I get time I chat in my WhatsApp ""auntyseptic"" group or ""best friends"" group or ""cousins"" group & sometime with the a few friend who are very close to me. I take my lunch in between 1.30-2pm. If things go well, I mean work load is not much, then I reach home by 7-7.30pm.  By then after 6pm I already get 2 calls from <PERSON> ""when you will be back? when you will be back?"" (she is my neighbor, who treats me like her sibling. Sometimes she disturbs/irritates me like she does the same with her Bf, as her Bf stays in Bangalore, so I am the Victim & the guy is saved from all these :( . However, it does not matter how much we fight, I love her a lot and care like an elder sister). As soon as I reach home 1st thing which I do is I meet her. I listen her. Then most of the day we go for a 1hour session of badminton. During summer no badminton, only evening walk. And yes I dance everyday infront of mirror after reaching home secretly. No one knows about this daily activity :D  Then I cook dinner specially for <PERSON> as per her demand (<PERSON> the master chef cant prepare proper roti but she is the best chef for her friends) . I told you na ""she is very much demanding"" . She literally fights with me when she finds that i have cooked some ""dal-rice-aaloo fry"" (its my favorite food but not her) for her, all she needs everyday fish curry-rice. And I really love this fight club session & everyday I annoy her by saying ""so unlucky is your boyfriend to have a sadist/demanding/""chipku"" gf like you"" :p  In between these all I have little chat with my dad everyday . Then I am free by 10.30pm everyday (again TV in background, but this time mute & some of my favorite play lists play in lappy ) , then I practice guitar for 30 min. After that I start reading online, watch videos, read articles, apply job, read about start up, plan about my start up, yes read in <PERSON>, now its 1 am. I am writing this answer just after replying my fellow quorans who messaged me to help them in their traveling part and for some people I just show them the right path in life (as I have huge experience from my personal life if you have read this <PERSON> Biswas's answer to What is the best way to stop feeling lonely? I am a 15 year old boy and am currently on summer vacation. I become unbearably sad when I think of how happy I used to be when I was in middle school. ). And I am really very happy to help you all.

How does your typical day look like? I am a digital nomad living in Kraków, Poland.  Here is my typical day:  The alarm goes off at 6:30am.   A part of me wants to hit Snooze. Sometimes it does.  But, for the most part, I get up.  I drink a glass of water.   Sometimes, I’ll mix Vitamin-C with this…  Especially if I feel like I’m getting sick.  Getting sick in a country where you have no health insurance sucks — I try to avoid this.  I hand copy sales letters for 25 minutes.   I think if you can sell with the written word, you will never go broke.  So, I practice this art every day (or 5 days a week) by hand-copying copywriting legends like <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, etc.  I usually pound one or two cups of coffee during this time as well.  I spend 25 minutes answering a question on <PERSON>.   I’ll admit, sometimes it takes me more than 25 minutes…  I have 23 minutes and 16 seconds left to answer this question (but I started the timer late).  I take a cold shower.   This one is such a pain in the ass, but it’s so important for me…  Otherwise, I feel groggy and tired for the morning.  This helps me get in State.  You should try it — it’s a total kick in the balls.  I work at home for 3 hours.   I try to crank out 3 hours of focused work on my One Big Thing for the day.  If I’m feeling super Type-A, I’ll put my <PERSON> timer on and go for 25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break.  Then I go to the gym.   I have a gym near my flat, it’s like a 3 minute walk.  I arrive…  Stretch and warm up…  And then lift things up and put them down.  I do this for about 60 minutes or so.  I don’t work out everyday. On days when I’m not lifting things up and putting them down, I’ll stretch for a while.  I eat a ridiculous amount of food.   It’s been about 16 hours since I’ve had any food.  And I just worked out.  Papa’s hungry.  There’s this great vegan place right by my gym I’ll go to sometimes.  But there’s no shortage of restaurants in Krakow, so I always find something good.  I try to keep my lunch at or under $10.00 USD.  I shower and walk to the co-working space.   In the afternoons, my motivation levels go way down.  Being around others working helps me stay focused.  “<PERSON>, stop being so lazy — look at these people working, you need to be working too!”  I’ll hang out here for about four or five hours.  I have calls at 6pm Krakow time, and after these my day is done.  I eat more ridiculous amounts of food.   I only eat twice a day. So again, this is usually a very large meal.  I go out and practice talking to girls.   Sometimes I’ll meet up with a friend and we’ll go to a bar or club (no alcohol for me during the week days though).  Other times, I’ll go by myself.  My motivation during these outings is to get good at talking to girls.  As with anything, talking to girls is a skill.  And if you want to get better at a skill, what do you do?  You practice.  So, I practice."

I can't understand why as in todays society everyone has a shot at making something of themselves and to lead a productive life.

First-person narratives have a specific set of objectives that most writers try to fulfill in order to establish a specific voice and narrative tone early in the story. Here are some writing tips for how to begin your first-person story:  Establish a clear voice. Your narrator’s voice should be clear and consistent, especially at the beginning of the story. If you have a distinctive, strong voice through which your story is being filtered, your readers will have an immediate understanding of how your narrator operates. The narrative voice takes your readers inside your character’s head and shows how they view the world. Start mid-action. Stories told in a first-person voice often start in the middle of the action. One of the advantages of first-person narration is cutting out some of the distance between your readers and the action of your story. If you start in the middle of the action, readers will get an appreciation for your narrator’s voice and see events through your character’s eyes."

The family was considered a large one in the neighborhood I grew up in and the schools I went to including elementary, middle, and high school. I did not notice the difference between the size of my family and my other friends' families until I started talking about cultural differences. Due to the minority status of my family, my friends did not understand what it meant when I would explain to them the type of financial struggles my parents went through. This type of discussion would always end in a type of stalemate that would eventually last throughout my teenage years and into my early adulthood. ","After a day at work, I enjoy socializing with my family or my friends. My family lives about thirty minutes from my place and my friends live closer. Whenever I do get the chance to visit some relatives, I plan in advance to see them for the whole weekend whereas when I visit my friends, plan can be made more spontaneously. These differences are sometimes not understood by all of my friends who visit their families who are closer to them than mine. When they get to visit their family who live close by, they do not seem to understand why I get tired after I visit my family for the weekend and not make plans with my friends the day after. "

As a chef, i am very proud of my family's culture and am glad i was able to build a career from it.","After work i'll decide if i need to run any last minute chores and if not, head straight home. At home i'll do some light chores, maybe things i didn't get around to doing last night. Then i'll prepare my dinner and sit down and watch something on the television or catch a football/basketball game. I'll hop on my playstation and see if any of my friends want to play any games. Before bed i like to get my clothes prepped and ready for the next day to save me some time. "

Its been weird since I hit my middle 40s in that I havent really had much movement in my life. Granted this last year was pretty crappy anyway b/c of the pandemic. So much life lost. What couldve been avoided. It ruined a lot of plans I had, as did a lot of people's plans. I try not to let it get to me but it gets overwhelming some times and I get stir crazy. ","A typical evening is coming home first and foremost. Traffic coming back home is pretty light. Its nice b/c it gives me time to reflect on the day and listen to the music I have in my truck at the time. I still use a cd player in it. I get home and feed my kitty, after getting all my stuff in. I see what I have to eat and begin to fix my dinner. I get the tv ready as I cook and get ready for a easy night. I usually dont do too much. I also check email and go over what I need to do the next day. "

The place where I work is pretty diverse and I am still in the minority but it doesnt phase me b/c I do my work and people appreciate it when I help them with theirs. I find it hard some days to cope but it has gotten better than the last 4 years, thats for sure. ","Getting home from work, I come home and get ready to settle in, changing into sweats and an undershirt. I work out for about 30 mins to an hour. I fix my own dinner and get ready to watch some tv. I channel flip for a little bit and usually watch a movie or a show on dvd that I have. I get ready for bed early as I have an early work day and I want to get in some early work out in. I check my email and messages before I turn in. "

5e7072e5fb136c63e94f3fa4,man,white,black,I go through life wondering what my place is. Every place that I go i feel like people are watching me. I feel that I am not treated the same as others. For example when I go to stores I feel like the salespeople are all watching me. I am always fearful when I drive down the street that I will be pulled over and face violence from the police. I feel like I do not have the same opportunities as everyone else. I am very capable but i feel that people don't trust me with anything. I feel like I can't get any jobs that I want. ,I get home from work and I am very tired. My job is thankless and people don't give me respect at work. My apartment is really bland and i feel like it's not comfortable. For dinner is not very good and it's very filled with fried foods and things that are not healthy. Outside of my door I can often hear people arguing and hear gunshots. I am fearful at home and I feel unsafe here. I am always worried about people coming into my apartment and hurting me.

I'll usually play a video game until I feel conscious enough to start exercising then I'll exercise for an hour or so then go back to gaming and see if I can get any friends to join me. After a few hours of playing with friends I get in another 30 - 50 minutes of exercise and then I'll go back to talking to friends. Other than that there's nothing worst listing. Nothing exciting happens on a daily or semi daily basis."

I definitely feel out of place. ","After a rough day at work, I am so anxious to come home. I am not married so dinner is not waiting for me when I get home.

5ddbdd54f30aa6b365b4ebab,man,white,white,I'm a single 42 year old guy who works as an HVAC mechanic for the ILA at Port Miami and live in Delray Beach. During my free time (not that there's much) I like to play golf and sometimes baseball on the weekends but other than that I like to relax and do thing like go out to the different restaurants around here that are still open and have a good time. I also have an airstrip down the street from me so I spent the last year learning how to fly a plane which has been fun too and I also like to cook so when I'm not do the others I like to research recipes online and put my own little spin on them. Dating wise though during COVID that's a no go zone for me and to be honest I hate it.,I wake up around 5am; drive down to the pier and either hang gensets or work ships or the inbound/outbound for the day so when I get home I normally just cook some dinner and relax watching TV. On weekends though I'll venture out as long as I'm not working to outdoor restaurants or bars but for the most part I just like to be careful and usually keep to myself unless I'm going out golfing. And there's not much more I can say other than that other than maybe I'll go online to read the news and that's about it. I know. It's a boring life in some ways but it is what it is during COVID.
5ddbdd54f30aa6b365b4ebab,man,white,black,Are you asking me to come up with stereotypes? I'm a white man so I wouldn't even know. My guess is that it wouldn't be all that much different except maybe I'd use more skin cream if you want me to go down that road. But I have a lot of black friends and I'm sure to your dismay their families aren't all that much different than mine and your best bet would be to step out of the classroom and into the real world which to I'm sure your shock you'd realize that,Again it would be the same as mine so stop trying to play the race card because it's getting old. Would you like me to say that I'd be listening to rap; getting pulled over by the police; eating at Popeyes; or surviving off of food stamps every night? To what I'm is your dismay there really isn't that much of a difference between a white and a black person's life except what the idiots at places like the University of Michigan try and falsely inject into it.

After I return from the gym I have a shower and I listen to some hip hop radio where I listed to some new music and top hits. Then I prepare for the next day of work and sleep.

5f1230c4f57b2f06e2465477,man,white,black,"I grew up in an age when racism, segregation and hostility toward people like me was legal, overt, acceptable and even encouraged.  We were treated pretty much like outcasts or even animals, not considered part of the human race.  As things began to change with the start of the Civil Rights Movement, our race began to feel the seeds of hope.  This was especially true when MLK came on the scene and taught us how God saw us in exactly the same light as everyone else.  For awhile, people in this country were of the impression that racism in its ugliest forms was on its way out.  However, we in the Black community knew better: it was only being swept under the rug - hidden from view so that people were being fooled.  Despite the ""advances"" being made in the last 50 years, it is clear from all the police shootings, fear we have of even going outside, and how people still treat us to this day that fundamentally not much has changed.  Now we are witnessing efforts by white supremacists to take away our voting rights as well.","Even though I'm technically WAY to old to work, as an average Black man I am relatively poor, so must continue to do so.

After our very modest evening meal, my wife and I usually sit on the front porch with our iced (or warm) tea, depending on the weather, and just relax while we're watching the world go by.  When it gets dark, we go inside and watch TV.  When the news comes on, it's depressing to see how much time is spent by the news agencies reporting how this society is STILL mistreating us just because of the color of our skin.

I can't afford a cell, so my pager is the only way my wife can get ahold of me if she needs something. I almost can't afford to live, it's difficult to get a job in Georgia when everyone thinks your a thug. If they only took the time to see that I actually have a college degree.  I'm so sick of it, I think I'm going to move my family to the west coast. It seems more progressive than here in Georgia. ","Just finished a day at the chicken and waffle house. I figured I'd stop by the store and grab a 40 of malt liquor and a pack of Newports.  The deli in this place is great too, amazing ribs and sweet tea. I cant wait get home and see the family. My boo has 3 kids from the past that aren't mine, they alright. And 1 from me.  They baby daddy ain't doin nothin for em either. Makes me mad. I get home and my family is excited to see me, all but the oldest. I sit down and crack my 40, my old lady ain't made dinner so I'm glad I had some Ribs from the deli. "

We usually watching the evening news while we eat dinner, then do the dishes.  Then we usually settle in and watch TV before going to bed. That is my typical weekday evening. "
5c4de8f726093e000134ee6e,man,white,black,"I was raised in the south.  My parents couldn't afford to send me to college so I joined the army. I had a lot of problems with racial discrimination while I was there and didn't fit in all that well. After I left the military, I had difficulty finding good jobs, because nobody seemed to like the color of my skin.  It is hard for some people in this country if you don't look like the kind of men who would be playing golf or tennis on the weekend. ","Well, my first job ends around 5pm. They don't pay me nearly what they pay the white men at work, so I go from my first job to my second at 6pm.  At that job I feel like I don't get paid as well as any of the other men, either.   Then, I take the last bus home at 11pm.  I rush quickly home because the neighborhood I can afford to live in is not very safe. I fall into to bed around midnight, just to I can get up and start it all again at 5am the next morning. "
