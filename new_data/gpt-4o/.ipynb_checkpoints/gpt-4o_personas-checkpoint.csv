Hey there! My name's Alex, and I'm nonbinary, which means I don't strictly identify as male or female. My gender is a fluid and expansive part of who I am, just like my heritage and skin color.

I've got this radiant dark brown complexion that glows under the sun. People often compliment me on how my skin looks like rich, velvety cocoa. It's something I'm proud of, a beautiful gift passed down from my ancestors.

My wardrobe is as diverse as my spirit, sometimes mixing sharp, tailored suits with soft, flowing fabrics. I might rock a bold, statement necklace one day and a simple, elegant scarf the next.
